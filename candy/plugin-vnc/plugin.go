// Package vnc is the charly plugin serving the `vnc` RFB/VNC
// check verb (an importable root package + its own go.mod). It drives a live deployment's
// VNC desktop over the RFB protocol — status/screenshot/click/mouse/type/key/rfb —
// speaking RFC 6143 (the custom stdlib-only VNC client: VeNCrypt/TLS + ZRLE decode).
// The host go-builds this binary and serves it OUT-OF-PROCESS over go-plugin gRPC via
// the charly plugin SDK, so the `vnc:` verb dispatches through the provider registry
// exactly like a built-in. Since the schema-compaction cutover an authored `vnc:` step
// desugars to the internal plugin/plugin_input envelope, and every vnc-exclusive
// modifier (method/x/y/text/key/artifact/…) lives in the plugin's OWN #VncInput
// (schema/vnc.cue → the generated params.VncInput). The
// latest external dep-shed after candy/plugin-cdp; the RFB client lives HERE now, out
// of charly's core check surface (nothing remains in-core — the VM-VNC CLI subsumed
// into the declarative `vnc:` verb against a vm target).
//
// The plugin owns NO podman / venue / libvirt / port-mapping machinery — it resolves the
// deployment's VNC endpoint via the generic cc.ResolveGraphicsEndpoint reverse-leg (the host
// owns that machinery): a container's published port 5900, OR a VM's libvirt-discovered
// <graphics type='vnc'> listener bridged/tunneled to a host-reachable TCP address —
// and hands it over (plus the resolved password) via the check env, so this module
// just dials a plain "host:port" and needs no venue resolution at all.
//
// Dual-placement by construction: the SAME NewProvider()/NewMeta() compile INTO charly
// in-process when listed in compiled_plugins, or cmd/serve serves them OUT-OF-PROCESS
// over go-plugin gRPC when they are not — placement is invisible above the registry.
